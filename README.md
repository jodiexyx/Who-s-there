This repository contains our solution for "Facial Recognition" based on OpenFace library; 

Main functions:
Capture and detection of passenger's faces;
Comparison with existing contacts;
Addition of new contact into database;
Contacts removal;

Pipeline: 
When walking into a room with a camera-mounted glass frame, the user will be notified by the vocal instruction if someone walks into the sight; If it is detected as an existing contact, the software will say out the name of the contact; If not, the user could choose whether or not to add as a new contact by taking pictures and recording the name. In addition, the user could delete the contact during playback of the contacts' names.
